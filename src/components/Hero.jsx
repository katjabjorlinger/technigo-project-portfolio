            <img src="" alt="" />
                <p>I’m a curious and creative problem-solver with a passion for building thoughtful digital experiences. I enjoy turning complex ideas into something clear, usable, and human. My background combines design, communication, and tech – and I love working in the space where those meet.

                I’m driven by learning, simplicity, and the feeling of “yes – this works.” Whether I’m sketching, coding, or collaborating, I aim to create things that make sense and feel good to use.
